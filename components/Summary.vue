        Hi, my name is Dandi and I'm a 20-year-old frontend web developer. My
        passion for creating web applications led me to specialize in frontend
        development. I believe in using technology to improve the web
        experience, which is why I've made it my mission to create user-friendly
        applications.
      </p>

        Currently, I am a graduate of Alkademi Bootcamp with 4 months of
        experience in web development. During the program, I explored
        technologies such as Vue, Nuxt, Tailwind CSS, and Flowbite for front-end
        web development. Additionally, I also have a basic understanding of
        using Git for version control and project management with Trello. I am
        excited to continue developing my skills in web development and look for
        opportunities to contribute to challenging projects.
